When you are launching a new product or holding a sale, you may want to preview a new product that you are releasing on a new theme to make sure that it looks the way you want it to.

To preview a product in an unpublished theme, you need to get the theme preview URL and the product preview URL. Combine these URLs to create a preview of your unpublished product in your unpublished theme.

Step 1: Get the theme preview URL
From your Shopify admin, go to Online store > Themes.
On the theme you want to preview the product in, click on Actions, then Preview.
Click on Share preview. Your theme preview URL will look like this https://********.shopifypreview.com.
Click on Copy link.
Open a new browser tab and then paste the theme preview URL into the address bar. Press the enter key  to navigate to the theme preview.
 

Step 2: Get the product preview url
From your Shopify admin, go to Products.
Navigate to the product you want to preview.
Click on Preview to view the product in your currently published theme. You'll see a product preview page with a URL that looks like this ********.shopifypreview.com/products_preview?preview_key=********.
Copy the part of the URL starting at /products_preview. The part you copy will look like /products_preview?preview_key=********.
Navigate to the theme preview tab that you opened in part 1.
Append the product preview URL to the theme preview URL. Your final URL will look like this https://********.shopifypreview.com/products_preview?preview_key=********.
 

You can view your unpublished product on your unpublished theme using the URL you created by combining the theme preview and product preview URLs.
